The following is the complete description of the python project:
The Medico represents a cutting-edge healthcare solution that 
seamlessly connects doctors, patients, and administrators in a 
modern healthcare ecosystem. This system prioritizes 
authentication to ensure secure user access, and it employs role
based access control to tailor permissions for each user group. 
 
A significant feature of this system is its disease prediction 
functionality, which allows patients to input their symptoms. Using 
advanced algorithms and extensive medical knowledge databases, 
the system accurately predicts potential diseases and suggests 
suitable doctors who specialize in those conditions, streamlining 
the patient's path to relevant care. 
 
In addition to disease prediction, the system integrates 
telemedicine, providing patients with the convenience of online 
consultations. This feature breaks down geographical barriers and 
physical limitations, making healthcare more accessible and 
patient-centric. 
 
The Medico empowers patients to proactively manage their health, 
bridging the gap between healthcare professionals and those 
seeking their expertise. By offering convenient online consultations 
and ensuring precise disease predictions, this system aims to 
enhance healthcare outcomes and improve overall quality of life. It 
represents a pivotal step towards a more connected, accessible, 
and patient-focused healthcare landscape.
